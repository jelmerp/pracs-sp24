But if you want,\n  you can also switch to showing your actual repository / scripts during part\n  of the presentation (just be mindful of font sizes if you do the latter).\n\n- Start with some general background about the data / research project,\n  and an overview of the goals of the project. \n\n- You can see for yourself if you would like to run through some code\n  line-by-line, or give a more high-level overview of the code you've written.\n\n- At the end, briefly mention what you still have to do --\n  and if this is work that you will continue after this course,\n  you can also discuss this in a broader sense.\n  You can even explicitly ask for some advice, if you want.\n\n**What you will be graded on:**\n\n- Technical content  <span style=\"color:coral\"><i>[3 points]</i></span>\n- Contextualization <span style=\"color:coral\"><i>[2 points]</i></span>\n- Delivery <span style=\"color:coral\"><i>[2 points]</i></span>\n- Clarity <span style=\"color:coral\"><i>[2 points]</i></span>\n- Questions for other students <span style=\"color:coral\"><i>[1 point]</i></span>\n",
