# Personal introductions {background-color="dimgray"}

## Introductions: Jelmer

- Bioinformatician at MCIC in Wooster since June 2020
  - The majority of my time is spent providing research assistance,\
    working with grad students and postdocs on mostly genomic & transcriptomic data
  - I also teach: some courses, workshops, Code Club (<https://osu-codeclub.github.io>)

. . .

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

-   Background in animal evolutionary genomics & speciation

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

-   In my free time, I enjoy bird watching -- locally & all across the world

## Introductions: You

-   Name

-   Lab and Department

-   Research interests and/or current research topics

-   Something about you that is _not_ work-related

# Course overview {background-color="dimgray"}

## The core goals of this course

Learning skills to:

-   Do your research more reproducibly and efficiently

-   Prepare yourself for working with large "omics" datasets

## Course background: Reproducibility

-   Two related ideas:

    1.  Getting same results with an independent experiment (*replicable*)

    2.  Getting same results given the same data (*reproducible*)

    Our focus is on #2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Course background: Reproducibility (cont.)

> *"The most basic principle for reproducible research is: Do everything via code."*\
> —Karl Broman

<br>

-   Also important:

    -   Project organization and documentation (*week 2*)

    -   Sharing data and code (*for code: Git & GitHub, week 3*)

    -   How you code (*e.g. week 4 - shell scripts, and 6 - Nextflow*)

<br>

::: callout-tip
##### Another motivator: working reproducibly will benefit future you!
:::

## Course background: Efficiency and automation

-   Using code enables you to work more efficiently and automatically —\
    particularly useful when having to:

    -   Do repetitive tasks

    -   Recreate a figure or redo an analysis after adding a sample

    -   Redo a project after uncovering a mistake in the first data processing step.

## Course background: Omics data

- Omics data is increasingly important in biology, and most notably includes:
  - Genomics + Microbiomics + Metagenomics
  - Transcriptomics
  - Proteomics
  - Metabolomics

. . .

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

- While we'll be using some example omics datasets,
  this course will _not_ teach you how to analyze omics data in full ---
  our focus is on fundamental computational skills.

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
I should say that this course is less relevant for proteomics and metabolomics,
especially in its slimmed-down half-semester form with no R.

# Course topics {background-color="dimgray"}

## The Unix shell & shell scripts (Wk 1 & 4)

Being able to work in the Unix shell is a fundamental skill in computational biology.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

- You'll spend a lot of time with the Unix shell, starting this week
- We'll also write shell _scripts_, and will use VS Code for this and other purposes.

## Project organization and Markdown (Wk 2) {.nostretch}

Good project organization & documentation is a necessary starting point for reproducible research.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

- You'll learn best practices for project organization, file naming, etc.

- To document and report what you are doing, you'll use *Markdown* files.

<br>

## Version control with Git and GitHub (Wk 3)

Using version control, you can more effectively keep track of project progress,
collaborate, share code, revisit earlier versions, and undo.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

- *Git* is the version control software we will use,\
  and *GitHub* is the website that hosts Git projects (repositories).

- You'll also use Git+GitHub to hand in your final project assignments.

## High-performance computing with OSC (Wk 5)

Thanks to supercomputer resources, you can work with **very large datasets at speed** ---
running up to 100s of analyses in parallel, and using much larger amounts of
memory and storage space than a personal computer has.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

. . .

- We will use OSC throughout the course, and you'll get a brief intro to it today.
- In week 5, we'll learn to submit shell scripts as OSC "batch jobs" with Slurm,
  and use Conda to manage software.

## Automated workflow management (Wk 6) {.nostretch}

Using a workflow written with a workflow manager,
you can run and rerun entire analysis pipeline with a single command,
and easily change and rerun parts of it, too.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

- We'll use the workflow language *Nextflow*.

## Zoom

-   Be muted by default, but feel free to unmute yourself to ask questions any time.

-   Questions can also be asked in the chat.

-   Having your camera turned on as much as possible is appreciated!

. . .

-   "Screen real estate" — large/multiple monitors or multiple devices best.

-   Be ready to share your screen.

## Websites & Books

- I will only use the CarmenCanvas website for **Announcements**.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

- The GitHub website is the main website for the course, containing all course material:
  -   Overviews of each week & readings
  -   Slide decks and lecture pages
  -   Exercises
  -   Final project assignment information

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

. . .

- Books:

  - Computing Skills for Biologists ("CSB"; Allesina & Wilmes 2019)
  - Bioinformatics Data Skills ("Buffalo"; Buffalo 2015)

# Homework {background-color="dimgray"}

## Final project (graded)

Plan and implement a small computational project, with the following checkpoints:

-   I: **Proposal** (due week 4 -- 10 points)

-   II: **Draft** (due week 6 -- 10 points)

-   III: **Oral presentations** on Zoom (week 7 -- 10 points)

-   IV: **Final submission** (due April 29 -- 20 points)

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

. . .

::: callout-tip
#### Data sets for the final project

If you have your own data set & analysis ideas, that is ideal. If not, I can provide you with this.

More information about the final project will follow in week 2 or 3.
:::

## Ungraded homework

-   Weekly readings — somewhat up to you when to do these

-   Weekly exercises — I recommend doing these on Fridays

-   Miscellaneous small assignments such as surveys and account setup.

<br>

::: callout-note
### Weekly materials & homework

I will try add the materials for each week on the preceding Friday ---
at the least the week's overview and readings.

None of this homework had to be handed in.
:::

## Weekly recitation on Monday

If there is interest, we can have a weekly Monday meeting in which we go through the exercises for
the preceding week.

<br>
