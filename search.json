    "text": "This is the GitHub website for the course Practical Computing Skills for Omics Data (PLNTPTH 6193), a 2-credit Independent Studies course at Ohio State University during the Spring semester of 2024.\nThe course is taught by by Jelmer Poelstra from OSU’s Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (MCIC) for the Department of Plant Pathology.\n\n\nCourse description\nAs datasets have rapidly grown larger in biology, coding has been recognized as an increasingly important skill for biologists. This is especially true in “omics” research with data from e.g. genomics and transcriptomics, which usually cannot be analyzed on a desktop computer, where most software has a command-line interface, and where workflows can include many steps that need to be coordinated.\nIn this course, students will gain hands-on experience with a set of general and versatile tools for data-intensive research. The course will focus on foundational skills such as working in the Unix shell and writing shell scripts, installing software, and submitting jobs at a compute cluster (the Ohio Supercomputer Center), and building flexible, automated workflows. Additionally, the course will cover reproducibly organizing, documenting, and version-controlling research projects. Taken together, this course will allow students to reproduce their own research, and enable others to reproduce their research, with as little as a single command.\n\n\n\nMore information\n\nTopics taught\n\nUnix shell basics and tools\nShell scripting\nComputing at OSC with Slurm batch jobs and Conda software management\nVersion control with Git and GitHub\nProject documentation with Markdown and project organization\nReproducible workflows with Nextflow\n\n\n\nCourse books\n\nAllesina S, Wilmes M (2019).

I will only use the CarmenCanvas site for this course for announcements and as a place to share some files with you.\n\n\nNo R in the course\nI’ve had to remove the modules on R while transitioning this course from 3-credit full-semester to 2-credit half-semester. To learn R at OSU, I can recommend our weekly Code Club meeting. And if you’re also interested in microbial metabarcoding data, or would like to learn how you can use R in a bioinformatics/omics data context, contact Plant Pathology professor Soledad Benitez-Ponce to sign up for a metabarcoding workshop during Spring break from March 13th-15th.\n\n\nGlossary\nIf some of the terms in the description of the course material are unfamiliar to you, take a look at the glossary page of this website. Of course, you will learn a lot more about these terms and concepts during the course!"

To access OSC, you will need to have an account. This course has its own OSC Project, and membership of this specific project will allow you to access our shared files and reserve “compute nodes”.\n\n\nWhat you should do\nAfter completing the pre-course survey, you will receive an invitation email from OSC referencing the course project number PASXXXX:\n\nIf you don’t have an OSC account yet\nFollow the instructions in the email to sign up for OSC and accept the invitation.\nIf you already have an OSC account\nThe email will likely tell you that you have been added to the project and don’t have to do anything.\nIn either case, check whether you can log in\nGo to https://ondemand.osc.edu and log in by typing your username and password on the left-hand side of the page. If you just created your account, it may take up to half an hour or so before you can log in.\n\nIf you have any questions about this or run into problems, don’t hesitate to contact Jelmer.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
